# Star Health

Star Health is a public health data platform.

https://starhealth.io/

Deployed on Vercel at https://starhealth.vercel.app/



## Migration from GCP

The goal of this effort is to move off of GCP in favor of lighter weight / more flexible solutions like GitHub and Vercel. 

Currently the codebase, database, authorization, app and function deployements are hosted on GCP/Firebase:
